This is an implementation of the Dancing Links algorithm by Dr Knuth.

The brute force implementation is extremely slow because it checks an arraylist of ignored rows and columns to see if it should skip them or not. I am going to refactor the bruteforce later to make it more efficient.

The DancingLinks.java solves the same problem in about half the execution time as the BruteForce.java
