This is an implementation of the Dancing Links algorithm by Dr Knuth.

This implementation doesn't fully work yet (DancingLinks.java), but the brute force does work (BruteForce.java).
The brute force implementation is extremely slow because it checks an arraylist of ignored rows and columns to see if it should skip them or not. I am going to refactor the bruteforce later to make it more efficient.
